# Custom Google Map

I chose to create a custom map for the Mural Arts program in Phildelphia based on their color scheme (Rock 523E37, Pearl Bush E5DAD6, Fountain Blue 54B6C0, Blue Chill 1098AD, Green custom (9-190-136)). Because their pallette has blue, I chose to create a dark background so the light blue water features would stand out. Also, I chose a compatible green color for land features as to avoid confusion. Then, I chose blue that the organization uses as the color for the titles.
